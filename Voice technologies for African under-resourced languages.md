## 1. Course Description
This course provides **hands-on training in the development of voice technologies** such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) for **under-resourced African languages**. Students will learn the basic principles of voice technology, how to build and curate language datasets, and how to train speech models using open-source tools.  
Emphasis will be placed on **practical engagement with local languages** and **collaborative development of language resources**.

---

## 2. Context and Rationale
The **rise of AI-powered language learning platforms** is transforming the way languages are acquired globally. Platforms such as [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) demonstrate how voice technology can enhance interactivity, promote learner autonomy, and support language revitalization.  
African languages, however, remain **largely absent from these digital platforms** due to the lack of digitized linguistic resources. By training future teachers to develop voice technologies, this course contributes to **linguistic inclusion**, **digital sovereignty**, and **language preservation**.

---

## 3. Course Objectives
- Introduce students to the principles and applications of voice technologies for language education.  
- Equip students with practical skills to build datasets and train simple ASR and TTS models.  
- Promote the integration of African languages into modern AI-driven learning platforms.  
- Foster critical thinking about the **ethical, cultural, and linguistic implications** of language technologies.

---

## 4. Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
- Explain the basic concepts and workflow of voice technology development.  
- Design and curate speech datasets adapted for machine learning.  
- Deploy basic ASR and/or TTS models using open-source tools (e.g., Google Colab, Hugging Face Transformers).  
- Evaluate and document voice models for educational use.  
- Engage in community-based language technology initiatives.

---

## 5. Prerequisites
- Basic computer literacy.  
- Access to a laptop or desktop computer with a functional microphone and stable internet.  
- Availability of a language corpus of at least **20,000 tokens** in standard orthography.  
- A Google account (for Colab use).

## 12. Capstone Project
Each student (or small group) will select an **African under-resourced language** and:
- collect or clean a text and audio corpus,  
- train an ASR or TTS model,  
- evaluate model performance, and  
- propose a use case in education (e.g., language learning app, oral literacy tool).
