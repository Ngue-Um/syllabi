## Description
This course provides an introduction to the language reality of Africa, with an emphasis on language classifications and the linguistic geography of the continent. Language classifications will be studied from the structural linguistics perspectice (phonology,morphology, syntax), but also from the sociolinguistics (external influences, language contact, etc.)  and sociocultural perspectives (migrations, urbanization, etc.). The course will also cover ethnolinguistic representations of African societies about their language reality.

  ## **Course objectives**

1. understand and critically assess the discourses about the language reality of Africa

3. disseminate the knowledge about topics of language diversity in Africa to the general public through Wikipedia and/or blog post, as well as social media outlets

4. successfully create maps by reusing publicly available R code.

5. engage with digital tools for the classification of the world's language.

6. Depending on their background, students will be able to gather and process information with any of the digital resources listed at the end of this document.
